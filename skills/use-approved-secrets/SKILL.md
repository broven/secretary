name: use-approved-secrets
description: Discover, use, and record Bitwarden-backed credentials through the local secretary broker and its Telegram approval channel. Use whenever a Code Agent needs to search or list available API keys, tokens, passwords, usernames, credentials, or secret environment variables; must run a command with an approved secret without revealing its value; or has just obtained a credential that should be stored in the vault instead of a file.

# Use Approved Secrets

## Prerequisite

This skill describes how to drive the `approved-secret` command. Installing the
skill does not install that command. If it is missing, stop and tell the user to
run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broven/secretary/main/install.sh | sh
```

If you are running it for them, add `SECRETARY_YES=1` — you have no terminal to
answer its prompts:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broven/secretary/main/install.sh | SECRETARY_YES=1 sh
```

Then the user points it at their broker: `auth set-url <their broker URL>` and
`auth import` (the token comes from `client add` on the broker host). Those two
steps are theirs — never ask for, accept, or echo the token.


Credentials live in a Bitwarden/Vaultwarden vault. The `approved-secret` command talks
to the secretary broker, which is the only thing that ever holds plaintext. You can:

- **read** the safe catalog (`list`) and run one command with secrets injected (`exec`);
- **write** to the vault (`create` / `update` / `remove`), each write approved by the
  Owner from Telegram.

You never see a credential value. Reads inject into a child process's environment;
writes take values from stdin or from the Owner directly.

## Reading

### 1. Find the item

```bash
approved-secret list github
approved-secret list github --json
```

Each item shows `name`, `fields`, `description` and `created_at`. **`description` is
the item's stated purpose** (it is the vault's notes field) — use it to decide whether
an item is the one you want. `created_at` tells you whether an item is one you just
made or one that predates you.

### 2. Run the command

Prepare the real command first, pick explicit env names, then run `exec` once. Write a
truthful `--reason` (≥10 characters): it appears verbatim on the approval card and is
the Owner's main basis for deciding.

```bash
# One item
approved-secret exec --reason "check which account the CI token belongs to" \
  --item "GitHub Automation" password=GITHUB_TOKEN \
  -- gh api user

# Several items, one approval, one command
approved-secret exec --reason "nightly sync between GitHub and OpenAI usage data" \
  --item "GitHub Automation" password=GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --item "OpenAI Prod"       password=OPENAI_KEY \
  -- ./scripts/sync
```

Every env name must be unique across all `--item` groups; each field may be bound once;
up to 10 items per approval. `exec` blocks until it has an answer. A previously approved
request may be reused silently with no Telegram prompt at all — so only tell the user to
go approve something once the command has actually been waiting a while.

Report the command result or the approval failure. **Never report a credential value.**

### What one approval covers

The Owner picks 1 hour, 8 hours, or 7 days. The authorization is stored per
**(caller, client, repository, item, field)** and matched by containment:

- Requesting a **subset** of what was approved reuses it silently.
- **Renaming the env variable does not re-trigger approval** — it is a local alias.
- **Rotating the value does not revoke it** — the item's identity is its id.
- Adding an item or field that was never approved does re-trigger approval.
- The command is **not** part of the authorization. The first time a given command runs
  against a given set of items, the Owner gets a non-blocking notification carrying the
  full argv and a revoke button. Execution is not delayed by it.

### Inline shell

Inline code (`sh -c`, `bash -lc`, `python -c`, …) is allowed and passed through verbatim.
It is approved **every single time** and never writes a reusable authorization, because
the whole code string is what the Owner is being asked to judge. Prefer it over a
throwaway script file when you need a pipeline — the inline string is visible on the
card, a script file's contents are not.

## Writing

Three verbs. **Every write needs the Owner's approval and never creates a read
authorization** — after writing, using the credential still goes through `exec`.

Values never appear in argv. A field's value comes from exactly one of:

- `@stdin` — you already have the value; pass it as a JSON object on standard input.
- `@owner` — the value must not enter your context; the Owner types it into a one-time
  web form. **Only `create` may use `@owner`.**

### create — a new item, or a new field on an existing item

```bash
# New item. --description is REQUIRED and is what tells a future agent what this is.
USERNAME_VALUE="ops@acme.com" PASSWORD_VALUE="$TOKEN" \
  jq -n '{username: env.USERNAME_VALUE, password: env.PASSWORD_VALUE}' | \
  approved-secret create --item "Acme Prod" \
    --description "Acme 生产环境部署账号，CI 用" \
    --field username=@stdin --field password=@stdin \
    --reason "刚注册完 Acme 账号，把凭据存进 vault"

# New field on an item that already exists — omit --description.
FIELD_VALUE="$KEY" jq -n '{api_key: env.FIELD_VALUE}' | \
  approved-secret create --item "Acme Prod" --field api_key=@stdin \
    --reason "Acme 新开了 API key，和账号存在一起"

# You must not see the value: the Owner fills it in.
USERNAME_VALUE="ops@acme.com" jq -n '{username: env.USERNAME_VALUE}' | \
  approved-secret create --item "Acme Prod" \
    --description "Acme 生产环境部署账号，CI 用" \
    --field username=@stdin --field password=@owner \
    --reason "注册完账号，密码由本人设置"
```

**`--description` is the intent switch.** With it you are creating a new item, and a
name that is already taken is an **error**. Without it you are adding fields to an item
that must already exist.

**If create reports the name is taken**, do not guess. Run `approved-secret list "<name>"`
and read its `description` and `created_at`:

- created seconds ago with your description → your previous attempt already succeeded;
  carry on.
- something else entirely → pick a different item name, or add your fields to it
  deliberately (drop `--description`).

Same for "already has field X": that means the field is there — use `update` to change
its value, or accept that a retry already landed.

### update — change a field's value, the item name, or the description

```bash
FIELD_VALUE="$NEW" jq -n '{password: env.FIELD_VALUE}' | \
  approved-secret update --item "Acme Prod" --field password=@stdin \
    --reason "Acme 生产 token 已轮换，同步 vault 里的旧值"

approved-secret update --item "Acme Prod" --rename "Acme Production" \
  --reason "统一命名，和其它条目对齐"

approved-secret update --item "Acme Prod" --description "Acme 生产部署账号，仅 CI 使用" \
  --reason "补一句用途，避免以后认错条目"
```

One `update` changes **one kind of thing** — field values, or the name, or the
description. Not two at once.

If the vault already holds the value you are asking for, the command succeeds as
"unchanged" and the Owner is not disturbed. That is what makes a retry safe.

`update` cannot use `@owner`. If the Owner must supply a new value without you seeing
it, they do it in their vault client, or you `remove` the field and `create` it again.

### remove — soft-delete an item, or delete a field

```bash
approved-secret remove --item "Acme Prod" --reason "服务已下线，条目不再需要"
approved-secret remove --item "Acme Prod" --field api_key --reason "这个 key 已作废撤销"
```

- Removing an **item** puts it in the vault's trash — recoverable.
- Removing a **field** is **irreversible**: the vault keeps no history for fields.
- Either way, existing authorizations for what was removed are revoked. Restoring an
  item from the trash does **not** bring them back.

### The Owner-entry link

A `create` with any `@owner` field does **not** block. It prints a one-time link and
exits without writing anything:

```
需要 Owner 本人填写以下字段：password
录入链接（一次性，2030-01-01T00:10:00.000Z 前有效）：
https://broker.example/entry/…
尚未写入 vault。请把链接交给本人，填完后再继续。
```

Treat that link as **credential-equivalent**: whoever holds it can complete that one
write. Show it to the user once. Do not write it to a file, do not repeat it, do not put
it in a commit message or an issue. Then **stop and wait** — the user will tell you when
they have filled it in. Confirm with `approved-secret list "<item>"` before continuing.

## Safety Rules

- **Never put a secret value in argv**, a URL, a file, logs, chat, or source code. The
  CLI refuses `--field NAME=<value>` for exactly this reason.
- Never print or inspect secret-bearing environment variables with `env`, `printenv`,
  `echo`, debug dumps, or `set -x`.
- Never call `bw`, `rbw`, `fnox`, or Bitwarden APIs directly for an interactive secret
  request.
- Do not bind secrets to control names such as `PATH`, `HOME`, `SECRETARY_*`, `BW_*`,
  or `MISE_*`; the runner rejects them.
- Do not background the broker or poll its internal APIs. One foreground command owns
  start, waiting, timeout, and cancellation.
- Use `--json` only to parse catalog metadata; catalog output never contains values.
- If approval is denied or times out, **fail closed**. Do not resend. Retry only when
  the user asks or is ready to approve.
- **Never weaken, pad, or genericise `--reason`.** If you cannot state a specific
  purpose, you should not be asking.
- After a network failure on a write, **do not blindly retry**. Run
  `approved-secret list "<item>"` first: the write may already have landed.
- If a credential you need is absent, say what catalog entry is needed. Creating it is a
  deliberate `create`, with a real description — not a guess.

Token setup is a human-only bootstrap action. If the command reports that no token is
configured, ask the user to run `approved-secret auth import`; never request or accept
the token in chat.
